.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a terminal multiplexer,
a program that allows multiple terminal sessions to run within a single
(physical or virtual)
terminal session.
.Pp
The options are
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl T Ar HOST
Assume that the host terminal
.Po
i.e. the terminal under which
.Nm
is running
.Pc
is of type
.Ar HOST "."
By default,
the contents of the
.Ev TERM
environment variable are used.
.It Fl t Ar TERMINAL
Set the
.Ev TERM
environment variable within the mtm session to
.Ar TERM "."
By default, this is
.Em "eterm-color" "."
.It Fl c Ar CHARACTER
Commands are prefixed using
.Ar CHARACTER
in combination with the
.Dq control
key.
By default this is
.Dq "g" "."
.It Fl b Ar COLOR
Set the title bar color to
.Ar COLOR ","
which may be one of
.Li black ","
.Li red ","
.Li green ","
.Li yellow ","
.Li blue ","
.Li magenta ","
.Li cyan ","
or
.Li white
.Po
the default
.Pc "."
.It Fl s Ar FILE
Specify a status file.
See
.Sx "The Status File"
below.
.It Fl S Ar INTERVAL
Specify an interval in seconds.
The status file will be checked this often.
.El
.Pp
.Ss Usage
.Nm
divides the screen into multiple virtual terminals.
Each virtual terminal is updated and accessed independently.
At any given time,
exactly one virtual terminal is
.Dq focused ","
meaning that it receives any typed characters.
The currently-focused terminal is indicated by the location of the cursor.
.Pp
While running,
the following keys are recognized as commands to
.Nm
when prefixed with the command character:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em "Up/Down/Right/Left Arrow"
Select the terminal above/below/to the right of/to the left of the currently focused one.
.It Em "h" "or" "v"
Split the focused terminal in half horizontally
.Pq "for 'h'"
or vertically
.Pq "for 'v'" ";"
the newly-created terminal will be focused.
.It Em "w"
Delete the currently focused terminal.
.It Em "l"
.Pq "the letter ell"
Redraw the screen.
.El
.Pp
Note that these command keys,
and the default prefix,
can be changed at compile time and therefore may be different for this installation of
.Nm "."
.Pp
.Nm
will exit when its last virtual terminal is closed.
.Ss The Status File
If
.Nm
has been given the name of a status file
.Po
via the
.Fl s
option
.Pc ","
it will periodically check the contents of this file.
The first one hundred bytes in this file will be displayed in the status bar
before any window title.
.Pp
This is useful for displaying continually-updated information.
For example,
a simple script could be written to loop and update the status area with the
current time and date, laptop battery power, etc.
.Ss The Value of Fl t
The terminal name passed to
.Fl t
does not change how
.Nm
interprets command sequences,
but rather changes what kind of terminal
.Nm
claims to be.
Safe bets for this value are
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It mtm
This is the terminal described by the
.Pa mtm.ti
.Xr terminfo 5
description that shipped with
.Nm "."
It is not necessarily installed on your system,
but if it is, it will tell programs how to use all of the
.Nm
features,
including cursor visibility changes.
.It eterm-color
This is the default.
It is widely supported and its description is installed by default on most systems.
The only user-visible difference when using this terminal name is that programs will
not necessarily know how to change cursor visibility.
.El
.Ss The mtm Environment
.Nm
sets the
.Ev MTM
environment variable to its process ID
.Po
see
.Xr getpid 2
.Pc "."
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the operation of
.Nm mtm ":"
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev TERM
Names the hosting terminal's type.
This can be overridden using the
.Fl T
option.
.It Ev ESCDELAY
This variable specifies the number of milliseconds
.Nm
will wait after seeing an escape character for a special character sequence to complete.
By default this is 1000
.Pq "one second" "."
.It Ev LC_CTYPE Ev LC_ALL Ev LANG
These variables are consulted to determine the encoding used for textual data.
.It SHELL
If set,
.Nm
will launch the program named by this command in new virtual terminals.
If this is unset,
.Nm
will use the value of the
.Dq "command interpreter"
field of the password database
.Po
see
.Xr passwd 5
.Pc
if available,
and will finally use
.Pa "/bin/sh" "."

.Sh BUGS
.Pp
.Nm
will attempt to fit all virtual terminals in the window at once.
If many terminals are created and the containing window is shrunk too small,
the display will be suboptimal.
.Pp
The only human language in which output is generated and in which documentation
is available is English,
regardless of the user's preferred language.
